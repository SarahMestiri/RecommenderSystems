# Recommender Systems
## Introduction
This repository contains resources about Recommender Systems as well as my RecSys projects trying out different methods.

**Do you know that recommendation engine knows you better than you best friend?** 

Amazon, Netflix, Zalando, and many other companies are providing each customer a personalized user experience through recommendations. These recommendations fit the customer's interests. That means, if you are a software engineer, then Amazon will suggest programming books for you, and if you are a new mom, then it will suggest baby toys, diaper,etc. 
The magic of recommender systems is more than that: they not only ***provide you with what you need***, but also ***surprise you with things that you didn't know you will like***!

**How is this unique "You" leveraged by recommender systems?**

Let's discover that by learning more about one of the most famous methods for recommender systems: *Collaborative Filtering (CF)*!

Note: If you want to get an idea about the different types of recommender systems. check this article [5 Types of Recommenders](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/5-types-of-recommenders).

## Collaborative Filtering 
The basic idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who agreed in certain evalution patters in the past, are likely to agree again in the future.
