## Book recommendation system using collaborative filtering

[Notebook link to the project](https://github.com/SarahMestiri/RecommenderSystems/blob/master/Projects/Book%20Recommendation%20System%20using%20CF.ipynb)

In this project, I explored different collaborative filtering(CF) methods using [book-crossing dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/). <br>
First, I prepared the data since the dataset has different informations in 3 tables. After that, I tried user-based CF and item-based CF. Then, I calculated cosine similarities between users and then predicted the results on the test set in order to see how much predicted results are accurate.<br> Also, I tested results with a model-based method, Stochastic Gradient Descent (**SGD**).
